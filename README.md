# zero2hello

This project is created to understand all the steps involved in printing "hello" from an MCU via UART.
The code will be developed outside of any IDE, only using VS Code as a text editor and some command line tools.

This documentation will be updated as the project progresses and it's main purpose is to document everything I learn and hopefully it will serve as a complete, in-depth guide for others who want to understand how code gets executed on an MCU without hiding any details.

## Overview

The following steps will be carried out throughout this project:

1. setting up the MCU by writing the **linker script** and the **startup code**
2. setting up a build environment by creating a **Makefile**
3. writing a **GPIO driver**
4. writing a **UART driver**
5. implementing **syscalls** (\_write, \_sbrk)
6. implementing **printf** using UART
7. importing the **C standard library**

Tools used in this project:

- text editor: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- build toolchain: [arm-none-eabi-gcc](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/gnu-rm)
- build automation: [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- debugger: [Ozone](https://www.segger.com/products/development-tools/ozone-j-link-debugger/)

## Hardware and Documentation:

The hardware used during this project is an [STM32F103RB Nucleo board](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f103rb.html). This is a development board with an integrated [ST-LINK V2](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/st-link-v2.html) debugger/programmer and with the [STM32F103RB MCU](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f103rb.html) that is based on the [ARM Cortex-M3 processor](https://developer.arm.com/Processors/Cortex-M3).

Documentation is available on these 3 levels:

**Datasheets** usually gives a short overview of the funcionalities and electrical characteristics.  
**Reference manuals** go more in depth and explain all the features in detail.  
**User manuals** are similar to reference manuals but usully more geared towards the applicaiton developer.

There might be some overlap between the different levels of documentation but generally on Cortex-M3 level you find information on how the processor works, the instruction set it uses, it's power management and it's core peripherals like NVIC, SCB, SysTick etc.  
The STM32F103RB level is about MCU specific features like MCU periherals(GPIO, UART, SPI, I2C, DMA, Timers etc.), memory map and all other features that are mentioned as `optional` or `implementation-defined` on the Cortex-M3 level.  
In the Nucleo 64 documentation you find information on the hardware layout like the power supply, LEDs, push buttons and clock sources.

## Getting to know our Hardware

Before starting to code we have to understand how our code will run.

A good place to start is to figure out what the hardware does right after it gets powered up. Based on the [pseudo code](#Reset-behaviour) found under 'Reset behaviour' in the [Armv7M architecture guide](https://developer.arm.com/documentation#f[navigationhierarchiescontenttype]=Architecture%20Document&cf[navigationhierarchiesproducts]=Architectures,CPU%20Architecture,M-Profile) (which is the architecture the M3 processor implements) the following things happen:

1. Execution mode is set to Thread mode.
2. PRIMASK, FAULTMASK and BASEPRI registers are set to 0, effectively enabling all exceptions and interrupts.
3. SPSEL and nPRIV bit of the CONTROL register are set to 0, which means privileged execution and using MSP as the stack pointer.
4. All exceptions are deactivated.
5. SCS are reset.
6. R0-R12 are set to an arbitrary value.
7. VTOR is set to 0.
8. MSP is initialized with the first entry in the vector table.
9. APSR is set to a random number
10. IPSR is set to 0.
11. EPSR.T is set to bit[0] of 2nd entry of the vector table
12. Excecution branches to the 2nd entry of the vector table. (after setting bit[0] to 0)
